# Coffee Shop

## Write a class called CoffeeShop, which has three instance variables:

  ```
  name : a string (basically, of the shop)
  menu : an array of items (of object type), with each item containing the item (name of the item), type (whether food or a drink) and price.
  orders : an empty array
  ```
## and seven methods:
  ```
  addOrder: adds the name of the item to the end of the orders array if it exists on the menu. Otherwise, return "This item is currently unavailable!"
  fulfillOrder: if the orders array is not empty, return "The {item} is ready!". If the orders array is empty, return "All orders have been fulfilled!"
  listOrders: returns the list of orders taken, otherwise, an empty array.
  dueAmount: returns the total amount due for the orders taken.
  cheapestItem: returns the name of the cheapest item on the menu.
  drinksOnly: returns only the item names of type drink from the menu.
  foodOnly: returns only the item names of type food from the menu.
  ```
IMPORTANT: Orders are fulfilled in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) order.

  ```
  tcs.addOrder("hot cocoa") ➞ "This item is currently unavailable!"
  // Tesha's coffee shop does not sell hot cocoa
  tcs.addOrder("iced tea") ➞ "This item is currently unavailable!"
  // specifying the variant of "iced tea" will help the process

  tcs.addOrder("cinnamon roll") ➞  "Order added!"
  tcs.addOrder("iced coffee") ➞ "Order added!"
  tcs.listOrders ➞ ["cinnamon roll", "iced coffee"]
  // the list of all the items in the current order

  tcs.dueAmount() ➞ 2.17

  tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "The cinnamon roll is ready!"
  tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "The iced coffee is ready!"
  tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "All orders have been fulfilled!"
  // all orders have been presumably served

  tcs.listOrders() ➞ []
  // an empty array is returned if all orders have been exhausted

  tcs.dueAmount() ➞ 0.0
  // no new orders taken, expect a zero payable

  tcs.cheapestItem() ➞ "lemonade"
  tcs.drinksOnly() ➞ ["orange juice", "lemonade", "cranberry juice", "pineapple juice", "lemon iced tea", "vanilla chai latte", "hot chocolate", "iced coffee"]
  tcs.foodOnly() ➞ ["tuna sandwich", "ham and cheese sandwich", "bacon and egg", "steak", "hamburger", "cinnamon roll"]
  ```
##Round off due amount up to two decimal places.
