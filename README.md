# CODING CHALLENGE 1

## Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index, which is calculated using the formula:
## BMI = mass / height^2 where mass in kg and height in meter).

#### 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
#### 2. Calculate both their BMIs
#### 3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John
#### 4. Print a string to the console containing the bariable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

# CODING CHALLENGE 2

## Jhon and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the lastest 3 games, Jhon's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

#### 1. Calculate the average score for each team
#### 2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
#### 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw.
#### 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the consle.
#### 5. Like before, change the scores to generete different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.

# CODING CHALLENGE 3 

## John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bill were $124, $48, $268.

## To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill 
## when the bill is less than 50$, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

## In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
#### 1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
#### 2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)

# CODING CHALLENGE 4

## Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement
## the same functionality with objects and methods.

#### 1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height
#### 2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.
#### 3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.

### BMI = mass / height^2

# CODING CHALLENGE 5

## Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!

## This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
## Jhon likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

## Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:

#### 1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
#### 2. Add a method to calculate the tip
#### 3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
#### 4. As an output, create:
    a) New array containing all tips
    b) New array containing final paids.
    
# EXTRA AFTER FINISHING:
## Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110 and $45. Mark likes to to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300 and 25% if the bill is more than $300(different than John).

#### 5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules
#### 6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips
#### 7. Calculate the average tip for each family
#### 8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average
